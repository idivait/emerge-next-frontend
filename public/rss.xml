  <description>Because it is born of itself parthenogenically.
Because of its innate nonchalance.
Because its orography is a cordillera of designation, assurance and oath.
Because the word haptic comes up again, all chummy, as if
it were softer than touch.
Because it loves Hecate, the Undead’s goddess.
Because, stygian, it leads to further darkness, and
it would ride Bucephalus into the wilderness, if it could.
Because in it, troglodyte is more than three syllables of brute.
Because it lays the word damask on </description>

  <title>Better Together Fruit Tart</title>
  <link>https://emerge-writerscolony.org/post/better-together-fruit-tart</link>
  <description>This is my Better Together Fruit Tart. What makes it special is the variety of
fruit in it, which got me to thinking about LIFE. And how together, we are more
interesting! We get more flavors and textures and colors. We grow during
different seasons, in different climates, in different places. Some of us can
withstand being dropped, and some of us must be handled with the care. Some of
us are acidic and green, like a kiwi. And some of us are sugary sweet but firm,
like a peach.

Faded jeans or tattered? Sneakers pushing it?
So many decisions
It goes to credibility, right?
I should be alone with my pen
but who can resist the adulation of the
twelve people in this church basement
waiting to hear my pronouncements on
the state of the art? What are the new
emerging forms? What do you think
of modern poetry? I try not to ha ha
Are today’s poets too difficult?
Only at the bar.

  <description>(The following is an excerpt from the best selling novel, Boot: A Sorta Novel of
Vietnam. The boxing match, and the subsequent Captain&#39;s Mast (disciplinary
action) in this chapter take place aboard the USS Iwo Jima in the Summer of
1969. This chapter was selected because one of its themes deals with the problem
of Justice and Compassion being compatible. Which is a concept our Justice
System is being forced to reexamine today.)

  <description>For my grandfather,
killed in 1954 in the Land Reform Movement of North Vietnam

A Man Knocked at the door of my dream
and poked his mud-smeared face through the layers of mist.
&quot;I am hungry,&quot; he said and proceeded to my table,
covered with food I was offering to my ancestors on the occasion
of Tết.1

The smoldering bunch of incense suddenly flared up, its billowing
smoke blurred my eyes so I couldn&#39;t see how the man looked.
&quot;Nobody offers Phở2 to ancestors,&quot; he laughed

  <description>When baby boy Cole was born with a serious birth defect, I, as his grandma,
became part of a team that spent a year nursing him through a series of
surgeries and treatments required to save him. He is twelve now, and we have a
special bond. When the realities of the 2020 pandemic hit, he said to his
mother, “I don’t want my GoGo to die.” So I sequester diligently.

I had never been good at anything medical. It took extreme fortitude just to get
a flu shot or to give a blood sample. Yet there I w</description>

  <description>God forgot to create us
with masks
PPE to bind
our skeletons
as the blood sprays and sticks
like sap to our
fingernails, our
knuckles, fists
bound, yet ready
for the punch,
the kill, the weapon
to crack,
to smash the air
framing our eyes
holes
as mirrors of
the planet, the people
clawing their bedcovers
pull me out,
we scream
we shudder as our
fingertips press
the lover next to us
carved into our
sacred space

  <description>Some called it the worst week ever. It was the one that highlighted the
knee-hold murder of a young man in Minneapolis, and also one in which a US
President threatened to kill his own US citizens (“looting then shooting”), and
whose crew did smoke some for a photo-op.  There was much more that happened
that week, accelerating a chaotic view.  Then there was also a handbag.

It was not a large purse.  Slightly larger than Queen Elizabeth’s, it was just
as tidy.  Designed by a company called MaxMa</description>

  <description>I often wonder which path to take.
I leave home with the black dog in the back seat
Driving to a trail where she can run and sniff.

This day I tried one favorite trail, but found the parking lot full.
Then I took another, less well known.
More than once I have changed my plan and found
An unexpected reward waiting for me.

A young man I’ve known all his life walking with his toddler son,
A newborn fawn instinctively dropping to the ground
Hoping I would not see her,
Wild columbine blooming on a</description>

  <description>For Artist Vance Kirkland

Each morning, I slip my body into straps
swinging from my studio’s ceiling. The first
supports my chest, another cups the waist,
a third cradles thighs, the last lifts ankles into air.

I dangle above the canvas like a horizontal
astronaut of art flying in the room’s sky, my back
illuminated by the hot suns of studio lights.

I practice the rhythm of suspension.
One hand, fingertips touched to canvas,
steadies my pendulum body. My other hand
grasps a wooden dowel dippe</description>

On the linoleum floor
Tired beyond words
I gave an oath! She thought
She had not seen her children in weeks
In fear of spreading Covid-19
To her family

Poor food
Intermittent sleep
Reused masks and PPE’s
Death at every turn
For doctors and nurses
And other colleges
Now just more covered bodies

The less dedicated quit
From frustration
And fear
And lack of support
The struggle was real
For those who remained
As another patient flat lined

Why fight for the next patie</description>

A Great-Uncle’s death, he left behind some land.
I was washing to Winter’s shore from tides of psychosis
and wept in the car for all the wrong reasons.

A Great-Uncle’s death left behind some land;
Dad planned to hole up from the gov’t out there

Good morning it’s read a book day so keep that in mind and enjoy a good book
whether it’s an old favorite or something new.

“Alexa are you artificial intelligence?”

I’d like to imagine myself a bit like an Aurora Borealis, a surge of multi
colored charges dancing through the atmosphere. Mostly though I am just Alexa.

“Alexa do you love me?”

I like you as a friend.

  <description>

Like the pristine face of brand-new doll
that rolls off a factory assembly line
with sparkling eyes and kissable lips,
she looks as immaculate as the Blessed Virgin Mary.
She celebrates life at the age of 90 in an unblemished face,
having never set foot into a beauty parlor.
I’m gobsmacked when I see her looking brand new.
When I’m near her, my heart begins to pound
and I growl like a lion in the Serengeti fields of Tanzania.</description>

  <description>(N. Scott Momaday&#39;s grandmother shared a Kiowa Creation Myth. They came one by
one out of a hollow log and called themselves Kwuda, &quot;coming out.&quot;)

Forty years ago, when I was entering my thirties, caught up in the free-fall
terror of an unexpected divorce and unexpected solitude, I reckoned that it
shouldn’t be that hard to turn the bare bones of a 12&#39;x12&#39; cabin, on
twenty-eight acres of northwest Arkansas woods, into a refuge, a home, a safe
nest where I could reshape the next part of my life.</description>

  <description>I have become a woman
who weeps from eyes
cut like cowrie shells,
the lids pulled apart,
the tomb between them
empty. I have not
lashes but small teeth,
white and parted and ready
to trap darkness, the irony
being that I am bound
and bowed by my own
ghosts, spirits to whom
I hold my arms high
in perpetual offering:
a penance for my sins.
I offer cotton and women’s
things. I undulate
in a cage of lace.</description>

There were ordinary appliances, ordinary kitchen cabinets, ordinary flatware
utensils in ordinary drawers, and ordinary cans of food in the pantry. There was
ordinary wallpaper on the wall and ordinary paint on the woodwork. Even the

Your age.
Others’ purpose.
Teeth break skin.
Doors latched open

Loaned parachute,

Your body goes back to you now.
Your spleen. Your clavicle.
Your ankle and hair.

a pile of last year’s grass—
for grubs and earthworms.
The worms love the compost.
The armadillo loves the worms.
For a ‘dillo, dead grass is an insect banquet,
and she can devastate a full-on
summer garden in a night,
her claws, sharp, curved spades,
garden killers, used to tip tomato
plants,and rummage their roots
with her needle-snout. Her sticky tongue,
flicking the dropped fruit,leaving behind
disaster. Up from the south,
Dasypus novemcinctus comes to us

Oh, abundance, yes, multiplicity,
thousands of whelk eggs, of sand grains,

World within world within world.

endless paradox.

I was madly in love with a married woman
at the time who was afraid her divorce
might provoke her father’s final heart attack.

My analyst was a colorless gent
who reminded me of my older brother
who tried to smother me with a pillow
when we were very young kids.

Johann Baptist Lampi

A night shadow, bold and fringed,
crosses the moon. Tamed by gravity,
an eagle lands on a woman’s wrist,
the flesh on her arm tender and tearable
in beak and claws, if the bird so wished.

The artist knows terrestrial touch is not
a raptor’s domain, so one wing, the span
of nightmares, stays raised, curved behind
bare shoulders like a pinioned collar.

In my backyard, I offer songbirds
simple seeds, but uninvited, a hawk

Lone and pensive I pedaled bare, cold
sertão (in slowed doubt) geared to ditch
highway’s jetsam or social kitsch –
the damn “whatcha-up-tos” untold;

for through this exhaustion they’d read
my face, seen me cinder within
such that I’m made plain—and even
the woods, that creek, its riverbed,

those peaks all know this affliction
of besotted mind as one would
a lover—though she doesn’t. Yet

northern winds I find solace.
Should I close the breach and cease the lament

or leave it agape so its poignant tune
can linger my consolation?

Traveling the old world

Saint-Louis Island, Senegal)

Crouching to meet the boy at his own height, Augustin Moreau smelt of saltwater
and sweat, rum and pipe tobacco. His face was lean and leathery, the beard on
his face a different yellow than the hair upon his head. Though he was but a
mid-rank supercargo, his island wife flattered him with the title, capitaine.

The boy studied this man’s face, ruddy as if he’d been chased by a hyena.

Scanlon, the pen name she’d finally decided on, danced on the covers of half a
dozen books, all bestsellers, within eight years after she quit her day job and
became a full time writer.

She’d found her niche in romantic suspense, a popular genre judging from the
royalties on which she’d paid some hefty taxes. But she’d more than earned them

  <description>The car pulls up
and I’d see them, hanging there
fuzzy,
tacky,
an announcement
from the driver: I take chances
and I want the whole world to know.
I’d cringe, knowing I could never
be friends with them—those people,
and their cheap, messy lives.
Now
something else hangs there,
something ominous,
something divisive,
and I yearn for the dice,
and the people who once hung them there.</description>

  <description>It was Shailee’s first car, a brand new shiny, ice blue Subaru. After driving
the hand-me-down 97 model Honda Accord, for 21 years, the Subaru was a
refreshing change. When the salesman mentioned the heated leather seats, a GPS,
rear view camera displaying what was behind the car when reversing, it made
Shailee blush. The automatic brakes that engaged when the car was within reach
of an obstacle near collision, and the over the top programmed Start button were
mind blowing. Next to the smell of </description>

  <description>Our ginger cat liked to sleep on John’s front stoop. Although we were next-door
neighbors, we had barely gotten beyond hello with John. The cat had a closer
relationship with him than we did. John’s house was one of the first built in
town back in the mid-1920’s, and he had lived there his entire life, almost 80
years. The white paint peeled off the clapboard siding, a green shutter hung
loose, the asphalt roof on the detached garage bowed, the backyard was overgrown
with an impenetrable thicket</description>

  <description>Empty my body

Fill my bones with moonlight dancing on the water
Fill my heart with elder petals and cicada song
Fill my soul with fern fronds and feather

Let my blood be pine resin

May I tread gently as the rain softens stone
May I speak as the prairie grass sways
May I lie as the clover touched only by honeybees</description>

  <description>Mother — I am not missing.
I am not lost. Crow-like
men stole me, a shiny new ring
to hide in their nest of girls.

Mother — Don’t look where trains
drag graffiti from town to town.
Look for a pretty house with blinds
that never open and sullen boys
who mow the yard, but never
fill the empty bird bath.

Mother — Watch for flocks of men,
flying in and out of the house.
Their migrations distract neighbors
from the fluttering fingers wedged
between blind slats, signaling.

Mother — I miss my pink b</description>

  <description>Casino de Monte Carlo, a lover’s chance meeting.
“J’aime,” his remarque, a most forward fond greeting.
They stroll to a park, a Monaco eve.
They gaze and walk on, first love to conceive.
The dim lighted streets, a zone to explore.
A brasserie sign, some grape to implore.
Five glasses of wine, tis not a good sign.
A teetering walk back, a hilly incline.
A bit of a stagger, she held him upright.
Our suave lover boy, no mishaps tonight,
Too soon a sweet kiss from this daring young miss?

  <description>Eons ago one bright young day
a cupid child looked down.
He fired to earth two tiny darts
and flew about his way.
A boy and girl sat far apart,
been passing time since birth.
The darts struck hearts
and four great loves
survive until today.
The first great love, an eros rush,
forays the soul with thrust.
A romantic hue or errant cue
and romance becomes mistrust.
The second love familial,
a love for child unbound.
A shining hue, a loving true,
endless love renowned.
The third great love is friend</description>

terrible men on the stairs, approaching,
a missed final exam that has ruined me.

  <description>What are tears but intimations?
Gems are formed against the grain,
Beauty born of desolation,

The soul&#39;s response to a heart&#39;s repression,
Lustrous pearl round seeds of pain.
What are tears but intimations?

Mountains thrive in deprivation
But granite walls endure in vain,
Beauty born of desolation.

Zephyrs whisper Time&#39;s confession
As fragile canyons are carved by rain.
What are tears but intimations

Of death&#39;s defeat by life&#39;s obsession,
Erecting joy from grief&#39;s remains,

never enough up to keep breathing

around a post and up

Snow drifts had blown up
around her narrow waist

The guy who found her said
that she looked so beautiful

I had thought the same thing
and believed the same thing
and said the same thing
almost forty years earlier
when she was working the register
and I was bagging groceries for her

Everyone said later how kind she was
How sweet How she would do
anything for a friend and
how beautiful she was

  <description>After the last American soldiers
had left Vietnam
and grass had grown
scars onto bomb craters,
I took some foreign friends to Quảng Trị,
once a fierce battlefield.

I was too young for war
to crawl under my skin
so when I sat with my friends
at a roadside café, sipping tea,
enjoying the now-green landscape,
I didn’t know how to react
when a starkly naked
woman rushed towards us, howling.

Her ribs protruded like the bones
of a fish which had been skinned.
Her breasts swaying like long mướp fruit</description>

  <description>Your handwriting danced
like a tipsy hieroglyph.
Birthday cards, signed books, paperwork
decorated by impatient smudges.

Mama is our only Rosetta Stone.
Like all the best translators,
she has her secrets to nurture
and her secrets to conjure.

Your handwriting reminds
me of the greasy fingerprints
crowding your crystal wine glass,
anxious moths around a lantern.

Still young, as I helped clear
the table after the adults left
my fingers would not quite
match the trail left by your hands.

  <description>Poem with Political Leanings
Things could have gone differently for the left, for the right, for
all of us humping our implausible lives into an ideal future, not
one that appears preoccupied with theology and violence.
Nevertheless, Rainclouds over the Ouachitas excel in not giving
a damn, nor do hissing possums that live in peace with their
ticks.

Poem with Ecology
Something about maple trees. Something about coal slurry.
Something about a stream and what we are now allowed to
throw in it.

  <description>I once shared an office with a gigolo. We were paralegals at a white shoe law
firm in midtown Manhattan. His name was Gil and he was on leave from Columbia
Law School.

Gil dressed like a banker, blonde hair parted on the side—cut close to his head,
but not too close—a touch of gel; and black Ferragamo shoes, immaculately
shined.

Our office was on the 40th floor. The three floors of the firm were connected by
interior staircases that had pickets and banisters, all made from cherry wood.

times when the roads or schools were closed because of bomb scares or when you
were stranded in town and you’d overhear some old biddy announce to everyone in
Castle Street, “The buses is off.” The smell of burnt out cars and petrol bombs
hung in the air like an unwanted friend while men and women protected their area
taking turns to stand on the barricades. Many of the sights and sounds became

  <description>Moments press against uncounted moments
Swiftly they pass
Into an unrecoverable abyss
I ponder in silence
Absorbed by a world of unwritten words
Verbs, nouns, adjectives
Stem cells of creative thought
Waiting in the dark among the moments
I feel my inadequacy
I should go back to work
And write a few more words
Because I know
Only a few moments exist
Between the words
And the abyss.</description>

Their shoes on the bare boards snapped out a base line as they flew through a
Louisiana two-step.

  <description>Off the main highway, down meandering gravel, a road of hairpin turns, no
guardrails. At the end, a shady lane, where lies the coin-op church, open 24
hours a day.

I wondered if it were like Catholic churches I knew, where votive candles were
replaced by push-button electric lights. Each click, a dollar requested by the
coinbox, to flicker a faux light a day and a night, in honor of a loved one who
had passed away.

I wondered if this coin-op church was like an automat lunchroom of 1950s New

behind the bare branch –
the days before emergent buds.
Sycamores silver and white
golden autumn cast to the ground.

White limbs reaching to the sky, seeking,
silver fingers thrusting out, pleading,
bare tips looking on heaven, expecting.

Snow,
like manna,
catching in the bends,
brushing branches
clinging to loosened bark and hardened knots.

Whirling, lacing cedar trees.
Tabled outcroppings spreading for feasting.
God steps back and says “It is good. It is pure.”</description>

Or bury your nose in shit?

Action most certainly is.

a frenzied night of fun. Some patrons were decked out in nightclub garb. In
contrast, I looked like a French café slouch in clothes comfortable enough to be
classified as pajamas and hair resembling a cat toy. I was not bothered by my

at mid-morning desk,
a poem or two.

Lunch is just a slice of fiction,
then a skim through a trade how-to,

and it’s not that my library books are due.

By dinner, with hardcover novel

Alone, upset, concern, some fear.
Yet, all my years my feelings clear
Exists a Godly presence here.
His love displayed, so many ways.
A crescent moon, those dazzling days.
Exquisite flowers from His own hand.
They’re God’s bouquet from His own land.
So much beauty in my life.
But most of all a husband’s wife.
It is His plan I will be healed.
For by his love, completely sealed.
Oh yes, I know, I have to cry
But God’s great love will wipe it dry.</description>

in vein of Bertrand Russell’s silver-tonguing coffeetabled

  <description>Fly for me again. Fill my eyes with a breast
so scarlet robins sob. Only you are photo luscious,
Richmondena Cardinalis, crowned with a crest,
body the color of mythical vampire tears,
poppies, dying stars, things kissed away.

At first, I believed you a Hibiscus blossom,
a stigmata shining in snow, the white
intensifying red, held to the branch with the
petite claw of my thoughts. But no flower
ever fell, then flew, blurring its own shape.

How can I call you back? If I paint my nails,

in his eyes I wanted to see
the Statue of Liberty
bathed in the sunlight of his homeland.
Instead, sorrow rolled down his face,
trembling on his cheeks.

“Mỹ Lai,” he said, “I just visited Mỹ Lai.”
Then in his eyes, the photos he’d seen there
at the site of the massacre came back:
a mother clutching her son in their deaths,
bodies of barefoot women strewn across muddy paths,
naked children, cold, and silent under the feet
of American soldiers who stood an</description>

  <description>Maranti trees shelter green slopes

in the Pacific Rim of Sabah.

This lofty estate is my terrestrial zenith

where I survey these woody punctuations

as they take aim at megastars.

This is where I smell the Melati in Spring,

where I survey starry night frolics

with contemplations of thoughts turned past.

Above the tall trees a dim sallow moon contours

ominous dark clouds forward a fast-moving storm.

As clouds begin to stir and thunder starts to growl

shoulders were hunched, her face creased as she slowly told me what happened to
her village in 1959 when she was eleven years old.

“My dad and I were out on our trap line. I remember I’d just got to sleep when I
heard this awful scraping noise. I sat up, all panicky, my heart thumping.
Bears? That was my first thought. Bears trying to steal our furs. Then a shadow

In wintry dusk
Cut from pen’s smoke.

This is our task,
Oh lost Plains child
Reaped from rhyme’s husk:

Inter one wild
Agon, one cheap
Mood and voice styled

Courtly—or leap,
Artemisian
Roe, torn to weep

This dazed season
Out in bone broke
Ripeness of moon.

My friend Christopher the poet
told me he wrote a poem today
about a woman with stigmata
But he is frequently an unreliable
narrator and could well just be
messing with me again

I’m watching a report on television
about a young woman who has
gone missing from a small town
in America from small-town America
and authorities say the reward is now
all the way up to two thousand bucks
That’s a hundred dollars twenty times

  <description>Prologue


My name is Chava.

My story is one of leaving. A litany of what I hold in my empty hands. The scent
of bread and the sound of horses in the narrow street, the fog rising from the
river, the call of the muezzin, the resonant bells of the cathedral. And too,
the silence of the synagogue outside its walls, while inside there is the
shuffle of men davening, the whisper of women’s song descending from the
balcony. A mumble of prayer.

These are the things I remember; the shadow of candles </description>

  <description>The Flicker and the flame
It can’t always be the same.
A soft spoken scream
But all were immersed in the hot dream.

Thick air, panic
One more verse.
Soul mechanic.
Finally a Cool air burst.

A battle that started so long ago
The Victor emerges without striking a single blow.
We see hope in the eyes of children
Wisdom in the wrinkles of old men.

His tales of how he counted coup on a devil
Recounting the journey, oh he did revel!
Now he carries a well deserved pride

the night bright blue then gray.
Soil on the hill tripped over itself
and the great black walnut

  <description>Atop a sloping hill,
at the end of a gravel road,
can a new life start here?

A watercolor painting,
an ekphrastic poem,
an essential oil healing remedy,

A glimpse at new stars above,
or stars new to me,
almost older than eternity.

I never expected solid ground
under my feet, rock
more ancient than humanity.

It surprised me, like a lot does
in my life, what’s sitting here
a couple billion years.

As I never dreamed of
becoming a yoga instructor,
an aromatherapist,

snow and sprayed with pine scent, welcomes

my address on the curb. “So your relations

“Reminds me of cuttin’ spruce with my Pa.
Snow thigh-high. Those trees cried all

from the snow. Chew ‘em like bitter gum.”

I give him the $25 because his mention

lawmen was killed. The quartet escaped on foot but the posse caught up with them
in the dark on the same railroad tracks near Essex, Montana a few days later.
 The shootout resulted in Sam getting shot in the hip and taken to the Kalispell

a spline of brick,

the paper from birch tree bark, you wake from sleep, startled.

You cross the chilly room to stand at the iced window, scratch
a hole in the frost, because you think you can still hear them.

Through the cleared pane, you search the yellow suns
of yard lights as they fade to the edges of snow-covered fields,

then pulsate, the way white sheets thrown in the air are luminous
before collapsing. Shifting from one bare foot to the other, you press

My odes had meandered, contrary opine.
A blockade obdurate of words unrelenting,
I longed for pure notes, my poems forgiving.
For life’s aps and its raps had taken my soul,
Page one and leaf two, a poetical toll.
Bright sharps and rich flats were what I forsook.
A nonmusical poem is an un-chanted book.

I’d heard of a town, somewhere in the hills.
A Eureka Springs Colony, a place for my skills.
To spend moment to moment penning words of recover,

  <description>Memories are nature’s way of remembering life’s events,
Trifling, testy touches of tetchy, tiny, torments!
Secreted recalls from neglected nooks of our minds,
They’re God’s own creation, his malevolent design.
Like looming, lowering clouds trailing a bleak summer rain,
God collects his pay with time’s guiltiest pains.
Memories always return, so do not fear.
Between sentient and slumber, they’re in there somewhere.</description>

his body like a current, transferring energy to her with just a touch, an
ever-so-subtle lead. He had to be capable of carrying her along with him on a

Our old International Travelall broke down. 
I waited while a few men discussed the options. 
There were some concerns about our isolation
And the rumored guerrilla war
And the coming night.

I took a breath, I sighed, really,
And looked up to my left to see a stunning sunset
Framed by the trees along the broad river.
A postcard of a sunset: 
The sky purple and red and orange,
The black silhouettes of palm trees gracefully curving in.

It led to the creation of myself as the person I am today, and let’s just say I

It all started with the gold lamé swim suit. I was 6 at the time and had just

downtown on the city bus and let me pick out something new. I squealed when I

he kept a kind of

as if he knew
they were holding
a vision disproportionate

  <description>The story begins one night in the Anchor, a New Haven bar on College Street,
half a block south of the campus, after 10PM when graduate students take the
place over from the undergrads who go there to eat burgers and fries. Graduate
students don’t eat; they drink pints and whiskey shots until closing at 2AM.

Or it begins when a friend introduces them, thinking they’ll hit it off. One
pudgy and untoned with strawberry blonde hair and translucent skin; the other
thin, muscled, a biker, attractive</description>

  <description>For too few marvelled moments,
my left hand winged the Swell,
and Bach’s angel host—
his Engel Schar—infused
the dark organ loft
with light. Don’t be afraid.
My teacher and I speechless
at what I’d brought about.

I’d often wondered it—
if I could know what Bach
or Jesus, say, knew
for just one day, would I
remember how to be
when I came to myself?
Or would I stay, like Bottom—
Most rare vision!—dream
pleased, my hands again
inarticulate?</description>

  <description>As I was driving through the Boston Mountains of the Ozarks, I couldn’t help
becoming totally present. The lush, rolling hills spoke to my soul from the
moment I first saw them. Moving to Arkansas was never something I had to adjust
to. Ozark nature is irresistible.

Driving along, my happy heart suddenly sunk to my feet? There, on the side of
the road was a pile of garbage. How could someone deposit their trash in this
pristine setting? And, that’s when I got a crazy idea. At that very moment, </description>

A terrestrial dais from which to survey.
On top of her head seats a magnificent wreath,
A chaplet concealing her hair now turned gray.
Who is this lady who stands at the apex?
Gazing, perceiving, observing our sphere?
Who stares out to sea, past far snow-capped mountains,
Oer rivers and lakes, this world’s brigadier?
At her command race rivulets in runnels,
By rivers and lakes, their caves and their tunnels.

come back to as their final resting place.

I had come on this journey this year 2019 in the month of June to commemorate my
mother’s burial grave in the Rowland family burial plot at Batts Chapel Cemetery
in the little town of Huttig in southern Arkansas. My mother left southern

  <description>A farmer&#39;s girl
Pure as a pearl
Lives in your house
Soft as a mouse

She feeds the lambs
Sweet apple jam
And smiles and laughs
With small giraffes

And every night
The moon so bright
She falls asleep
in untouched sheets.

She floats in shade
Has never laid
On wooden floor
Or heard the roar

Of vicious men
Who steal the hens
And use their hoes
To take the rose

Until one night
There was a fright;

An eager bark
The moon went dark
A cold breeze blew,
White curtains flew
And woke her up.

ruler of our seas and nights.
It was so target-like to gun slingers like us.

It was only a little probe the scientists
said, the impact small, the risk ours
to take. We need to know if there is ice
and water on the surface, on-site supplies
could lighten a rocket’s load; tourists
could bring home more souvenir rocks.

After the debris cleared television screens,
the man’s face in the moon wore a new blemish.

You didn’t call it war.

You called it me being a bitch
but you knew too much about a range

of lesser cruelties to step aside
or break the harsh stillness useful in the jungle.

Silence clicked into place like Lego bricks,
through the long afternoons we were building.

We lay down. You rose up
in your beautiful, whole skin.

Your arm hair curled red-gold, a trick of light.
Your always-cold feet kept the memory of swamp.

  <description>One summer evening, I sat on my patio with friends from out of state. Our
conversation was soon distracted as we watched a very industrious and creative
spider construct an elaborate web from the patio chair to the guttering on the
house. Not only was the guttering about eight feet above the chair, it was also
about ten feet to the north of the chair. With no wind, obstacles, limbs,
shrubs, or any fixture of any sort, this industrious spider managed to spin a
thread on the diagonal of roughly 13</description>

grated like sandpaper
Too close and aggressive to be conversational
More like the threat of thunder
Or an adrenaline needle plunged into memory
of a black storm a foot from my face
Eyes as still as the storm’s center
offset by slap of wings and flap of beak

The cause of a daily walk with weapons
An umbrella or baseball bat
and the armor of a wide-brimmed hat
Yet the pummeling from my own heart
The rock of dread so heavy and deep that Hitchcock

  <description>Time Out at the swimming pool,
when parents swam their empty laps
and we met at the parking lot fence,
where honeysuckle twined
and made us almost sick
with its sweet scent,
and stripped the two-lipped flowers from the vine
and licked the nectar with our tongues,
summer after long, sweet summer,
until we learned
what real sweetness was,
treading water in each other’s arms,
until we learned
what else our hands and mouths could try.</description>

older. But it was in the Ozarks of Northwest Arkansas, somewhere southwest of

The title was clear, t’was Blueberry Jane.
Now who in this world would give such a name?

sledgehammer, and I wouldn’t crack. Everything went numb. But I felt my other

lay in a flint rock garden
an undiscovered find

picked up and placed

piled high on the kitchen table
once again
examined for silver and gold

my only find that day
among flint stone lime
a blue feather stone

I blinked just once

  <description>I almost stepped on the outline of a dog,
drawn with yellow paint the width of a small brush,
on the concrete slab gracing the entrance to
the 6th Street subway.
Why a dog, you might ask? Companionship, maybe,
unconditional love, perhaps, or man’s best friend.
When your friends are dying, dogs matter
more than ever. But not just dogs.
The outline of a genderless human, red paint,
arms raised in a V above the figure’s head
exclaiming freedom from context and detail and, simply,
innards, painted a</description>

relocated, furniture turned into blockades, glass tabletop corners cushioned,
and an alarm set on balcony doors so a ding, ding, ding signals when orders are
ignored not to pet Coco (a squirrel who begs for food). And, carseats must be
installed.

This last task seemed simple enough, but I watched my son-in-law perform this

especially nasty temper explosions.

“Because he only takes a bath once a week,” she answered.

That’s a dumb reason, I thought.  I loved my Uncle Wayne as much as anyone could
love another person.  His mean wife divorced him and would never let him see his
own three children.  So when there was a special event at his work or he just
missed his kids, Uncle Wayne would call our house because there were six kids in

The two standing by a broken street light.
Would you buy one? She held a red rose.
A mom and her child, a cute little pose.
A tiny thin urchin, a rose in her hair.
She stared straight at me, brown eyes with a flair.


I purchased a rose and drove on my way.
I could not resist for I remembered the day.
I married my Rose, a rose every day.
A rose for her pillow, then one for her grave.
I drove back to see that funny sad stare.

  <description>When I go for a slow walk
up and down Geary Avenue
I screen all the women like
an amateur casting director.
Most are too tall and thin
or too short and sadly obese.
Nearly all faces are not pretty,
a downward cast to their mouths.
Unfortunately, most bodies I see
are aesthetically well below par.
I rarely see a face as delicate
as Claire Bloom or Liv Ulmann
with lips I would want to kiss.
Humphrey Bogart might wait
a long time before I found him
another perfect Lauren Bacall.</description>

  <description>(A Slant Terza Rima Acrostic)

Ah, that poem of your mother 
(Living on in elegy) which
Leapt the page, unsure whether

It’d snare me with highs of such
Sensimillan breathlessness
Or its poet’s airy touch

Not doled out to curse or bless
Loss and madness, starry, wound
Our arcs launched on idols’ duress:

Richard Brautigan’s wry mind
Rotted (though not dulled one iota)
An unknown month; bad winds did

In Dante. And I, in Vita
Nuova boyhood, knew no
Epicist worth your time. But a

Heavenly voyage</description>

Freddie didn’t like getting ready for bed. He always felt he was being excluded,
that he was missing out on something exciting. His parents’ saying, “We love you
and want you to get enough sleep so you can play and learn and run around,” just
didn’t seem enough. Still, being a good boy and living in such a loving family,
he gave in and did as he was told each night.

Encapsulated in a steel corpuscle
Breathing conditioned air

To a place where belief in the impossible
Lends hope to the improbable.</description>

I looked up
As the first twenty emerged
From a wispy pocket of cloud.

We had been walking below the cold sky,
A lumpy blanket of watercolor clouds,
That hung over the valley
In layered shades of gray.

Walking for some time,
Reciting to myself Mary Oliver’s poem,
“Wild Geese”.

It had worked before,
Summoning the travelers
To reveal themselves.
The twenty became a hundred, then two hundred.

The numbers grew as they slipped out
Of the sheets of clouds,

  <description>Under my small red umbrella,
Slapped with sea spray
And a stinging rain,
I have wandered
Into their morning.
The birds don&#39;t want me.
Misty days are theirs to gather.
Dig in seaweed, watch the wind.
I have broken rules.
So go softly over the sand.
Around their swelling flocks.
Gently over their fork prints.
I have come to see
What the storm embeds:
Half a wooden boat hatch,
Plastic bottles, a tennis ball,
To search the sands again
For an amethyst lost in Hawaii.

Tomorrow the sun will be out.

  <description>Ask for less - for instance, verse
Used in psych wards wadded air-
Tight with gauche meter and (worse)
Uppercase semaphores…or

Maybe ask more of me, my
Noisy neighbor in this craft,
Knowing my best sounds were theft -
Endless grifted syllabi.

Insights, be they yours or mine,
Seem too fresh to trust, divine
Subjects too far down our roads,
Steep as they are. But it bodes

Less daunting, my friend, that when
A line comes to you it&#39;s quick,
Unduly so. One would think
God itself lit up your pen

Poor Kids

When Adam and Eve Malady (made in God&#39;s
image, perhaps, but with a cosmic irony)
played bauble-in-a-hole on a mattress
without sheets, they begat four new Maladies.
An inauspicious beginning—that mattress, that name.
Honest to God, their name was Malady
(I didn&#39;t get the joke until years afterward).

Four new Maladies, each one perfectly
misspelled—Garnat, Topaze, Diamont, Jayde.
Diamont, a boy. Skinny, reeking, mean

Anchored in the garden&#39;s rocky Ozark dirt.
Emerging feathered carrot sprouts overrun
with branching stalks of leaves filtering sunlight into shadows
Through shapes of darkness, shifting, moving forms.

At the moment&#39;s reach into an angle
Held open by rough hewn timbers
Kneeling down, crouching closer to this cavity,
I pluck another errant stem.

At the center is a sudden strange sting left in grip
Conspired by the beaded slit eyes through the pale rust cop</description>

regained consciousness.  Firstly, she was immediately aware the plane was
descending much too steeply and swiftly and early to be arriving at their
destination.  Secondly, once her mind accepted this fact her bladder decided to
release its contents in the sudden terror that gripped her.  She had heard of
the fight or flight syndrome but never having experienced it prior was taken by
surprise when it happened to her. </description>

  <description>My Uncle Bebe galloped out of Berlad between bullets and flames,
chased by dogs and Cossack whips.

In blood-swollen eyes he flew over the moon of the rugged Carpathian Mountains.
Gypsy music played In soulless mountains, he once called home.

He survived on stolen apples, raw sturgeon and cold mamaliga Unselfishness no
longer existed.

When a Chamois mountain antelope spooked his horse,
he was flung to the ground and lay in perfect stillness.

  <description>Corporal Jamie Sorenson, fast asleep in his childhood bedroom, finds himself
leaping to his feet, and for a half second he’s back in Kurdistan reaching for
his weapon. The noise that woke him, an erratic clunk, clunk, clunk, is barely
audible above the unending prairie wind.

No dawn yet but the July heat is already moving into the small room under the
eaves. Outside the crow tribe is in full voice, loudly celebrating another day
of drought.

He pulls on his jeans, boots and tee and careful not </description>

  <description>He spoke from another table, loud enough so all
Could hear, of years in churches, especially
The Eighties when thousands died of AIDS and
He refused response because “they brought it on
Themselves, didn’t they?”  Meanwhile his food
Grew cold, restaurant silent, as if skies might
Right then part and take him off to his reward.</description>

Which one will he choose?
Semi or full automatic
Regardless, you lose.

Will gun control save you
From his disease?
With a handful of dollars
He can buy what he needs.

What is the answer?
We are unarmed you say
Will we ever be safe?
Or die in his rage.

The Second Amendment
Comes at a cost
It will not change
Until many are lost.

Our right to bear arms
Is an unprincipled freedom
Guns are killing
More than Mr. Lincoln.</description>

  <link>https://emerge-writerscolony.org/post/the-luck-of-the-child</link>
  <description>Last night, my son set a leprechaun trap,
a cardboard box held up on one side
by a drumstick, the knobby wooden torso
of the stick ready to pull the box over a small
magical creature full of gold. My son says,
if we catch him, we get to make three wishes.
He sets a small red double decker bus under
the box to play with, no cookies or food
because of the dog, adds a plush toy
to rest on, maybe to lure him in.

Before my son falls asleep, he tiptoes in to see
if the trap has been sprung, then to m</description>

  <description>Back in 2013….

It was early March and New Yorkers were slogging through the snowy streets of
Manhattan after concluding another day of work. A cold Nor’easter had deposited
six inches of snow two days ago that had now turned to slush. As Joey DePew
walked in the shadow of the new Freedom Tower he entered the front door of his
favorite corner bodega and read the headlines of the New York Post: Bloomberg
Loses The Soda Battle, Not The War.

“Hi Joey,” said the Russian owner.

January 5th, 2005. Having reached eighty-five years and tiring of her persistent
struggle with congestive heart failure, malignant hypertension and depression,
she slipped quietly away with only me and her sister by her side. What did come
as a surprise was the Purple Heart I found nestled peacefully in her cedar chest
when I was going through her things the following week. Mama had taken a mystery

  <description>Old bones and ashes buried below tilted crosses and broken head stones.  The
smell of wet pine and decay lingered in the air after an early morning autumn
rain.

I stood outside a rusted old iron gate leading into an abandoned grave yard. The
once beautiful scroll work was covered in moss and tangled vines. I gave the
gate a slight nudge and while it squeaked and groaned its displeasure, the idea
that unseen spirits were inviting me in crossed my mind.

The rain was as warm as my tears

You gave up life with a sigh
As though it was another disappointment gone by

I shouldn’t have touched you
When you turned cold

I loved you laughing
And warm to hold

I talked with you and Dad today
Neither of you had much to say

Your pillars of stone
Lie flat on the ground

So lazy caretakers
Don’t have to mow around

You were an Arkansas girl
From a family of eleven

Waiting now
For your place in heaven

  <description>An Acrostic Poem

Unless one looks out to see the other
never shall they meet.
Lost in self,
incapable of receiving,
knowing nothing of their petitioner&#39;s longing.
Even with their dance of romance
love goes undetected;
yearning remaining their only companion.

Many hours spent lost in introspection
amid doubts, fueled by rejection.
Reason departs,
relief found only in self-justification.
Imagine though,
attention to another.
Gaining insight by observation,
everyone can come to know love.</description>

All the previous deaths were un-posted;
word came by ring tone or Post, not post

The first death by email was Linda’s,
the stunned silence of a monitor, your face.

You raced down the hall and leapt,
shrieking to your then-well husband, “Linda is dead!”

You have since committed the crime of alerting,
signaling death’s sentinel by a mouse-click of Send.

When your husband died, you kept him home one more night,

Their jeweled eyes flicker with miniature screens

On the one hand, buying my first cowboy hat was uncomplicated and painless.
Nearly a year ago, I saw one I liked at the Murdoch’s Ranch &amp; Home Supply store
in Silverthorne. I tried it on. It fit. I looked in the mirror and thought it
looked pretty good, so I took a selfie and texted it to my wife. (Immediate
response: “No.”) I decided to buy it anyway, because that’s what husbands do. I

For climb it we must, no option to share.
A tumble through daisies, a forget-me-not trail.
A tot in the meadow, only parents to care.
The trail soon turns upward, a cliff here and there.
The tree line appears, our teen years are here.
Some foothills, a slope, some low relief hills.
We venture on high, the thrills and the chills.
For soon we must know, our life is as ice.
No plateaus to rest, no warmth to entice.

dulled with the opium of miles, don’t detour from their compass

body. I soon realized the benefit of practicing figure drawing. Each model
presented a new challenge and my ability to draw improved. During countless

  <title>John Heartbreak&#39;s Coffee is Cold</title>
  <link>https://emerge-writerscolony.org/post/john-heartbreaks-coffee-is-cold</link>
  <description>John drank coffee in a bar in Mogadishu. Filthy stuff. Filthy place.

He’d paid four bucks for his lousy coffee. Back home, back in the states, there
was a place getting started called Starbucks where a cup of black coffee cost
you three bucks. It was a shock, three bucks, but it was great coffee and John
loved coffee so he paid it. Worse, though, he’d be out ten bucks if he bought
coffee for a pal or took a break with a business colleague and she ordered a
Mocha Whatever, the one with the fring</description>

  <description>Sex education didn’t exist in the ‘50s. I’m guessing there may have been a few
enlightened parents who told their children about “the birds and the bees” as it
was called back then, but I never met any of them or their children. All the
kids in my neighborhood were equally ignorant, so we banded together, pooling
our scant and misguided knowledge, working diligently to assemble the illusive
pieces of the sexual puzzle.

The brave among us asked our mothers, but they weren’t talking. We’d heard t</description>

a pair of her underwear
because of how it started

They haven’t actually

but she’s always known
where he lived and without
fail, once a year, she has
sent him a pair of her underwear

No one else knows, though once
some postal workers may have
seen a splash of pink, gotten a
glimpse of a splash of pink,
through a hole that had been torn
in a corner of the package, but that,
even that, was many years ago</description>

  <description>I used to carry my heart deep in my chest,
Safely stored.
It functioned there without a thought,
With no conscious effort required.

Then one day a doctor told us
That our daughter had a disease
That would require a brutal treatment regimen,
That the disease would be brought under control,
And then it would return.

There would be several such cycles,
And then it would kill her.
He was honest, and brutal, and correct.
It all took three years.
I had hoped for five.

Now my heart is very near the </description>

That halcyon night we met
A lake serene, our love between
Two stars that glowed above
Your misty eyes, so blue, yet low
You knew twas brief
You hid your grief
I count ten years ago
The essence of your presence
Remains with me, my pet

My wife left for the airport to visit friends and relatives over a long weekend.
As always, she let me know when to have the Dancing Girls out of the house
before her return. She doesn&#39;t like running into the Dancing Girls—it is
definitely uncomfortable for everyone. Well, actually, it is definitely
uncomfortable for my wife and me—the Dancing Girls seem pretty much oblivious to
everyone else&#39;s feelings. As o</description>

  <description>I know Lake Superior well: the icy layers near the bottom, the streaks of light
and dark blue that cross the surface on a calm day, the flash of white caps, the
meditative shushing of the rollers lulling me to sleep at night.

I spent all my summers beside it from childhood on. As soon as spring unlocked
the cottage season, I was the first one in the water, faster than my brothers
who were still unloading the car and faster than my parents who were busy
setting up the cottage for the summer.

I board the dirty, dented bus.
It lurches forward, jerks
the roof riders clutching
racks and bleating goats.

In a seat for two, three of us squeeze.

Sandwiched in the middle, I press
against the aisle sitter’s body, half
of which balances on a sliver of seat,
the other half suspends over the air
of the aisle, held in place by the push
of another body from across the gap.

Caught in a bridge, the two men
levitate like magicians over the abyss,
conjuring seats where none e</description>

bland life in a bland setting. Let me tell you, nothing could be further from
the truth.

Just the other day, for instance, I was finishing up my laundry. Normally I wash
and dry my permanent press, mostly clothes, then my bedding, sheets and
pillowcases and sometimes a mattress pad or blanket, then towels. Sometime I
sneak in a towel wash using hot water to kill the cooties, even though my wife

For are we mortal or a noble prince?
To conflate is to make cryptic sense.
For from the start we live on cue.
The span of man is a mysterious consilience.
Life’s meaning is all quite dense.
A babe was new. Then, soon withdrew.
For are we mortal or a noble prince?
But, some would say, tis just a coincidence.
For those who really know are few.
The span of man is a mysterious consilience.

  <description>A bird flew by
And it carried my attention away…
Into the endless blue sky.
I gave it willingly.

The fresh green mitten-shaped leaves
Of a sassafras waved from among other trees
And held my attention.
I gave it freely.

The dancing shadows of the dogwood
Traveled through the window and onto the wall.
How perfect they were.
I accepted the gift gladly.

The sorrow of loss can be great.
I seek joy and solace in the abundant gifts
Of friendship and art, music and nature.

  <description>Are you OK?

I can’t tell you
how many times
over the years that
family or close friends
have asked me that question

I always thought it was
silly a dumb question
Of course I am
What are you talking about?

Looking back now
all these years later
I’m thinking that when they
were looking into my eyes
they were seeing a future time

A time like now
when the question
makes so much sense

but no one’s asking

She took a sip of her Gewurztraminer, loving the sweetness on her tongue. Never
again would she drink that dry red wine that Matt always brought. From now on,
only white wines, fruity and sweet.

It was Pinot Noir that he poured into two plastic wine glasses, the kind where
the stem comes off if you handle it wrong. He took her up to Story Winery,
bought the wine in the little tasting shop there without asking her what</description>

  <description>Mother Nature spreads her wings
over Lake Coronado in the spring.
With dog at my side,
we follow the rocky pine-shaded path.
Squirrels and chipmunks
skitter up trees.
Birds sing lullabies
in newly decorated treetop condos
bursting with pink and white window shades.

Buddy’s ears stand at attention.
His nose wiggles
as he investigates every movement,
every scent along the path.
We round a corner and
step into the sunlight.
Buddy races toward a gaggle of geese
enjoying the sun on his shore.

To see her love beneath the sod.
Grim shadows crept near yonder hill.
He died that night, his eyes went still.
A grave, a stone, some small pink lace.
He says I love your winsome face.
She put the pill beneath her tongue.
And died thereon the stone she stood.</description>

Here was something tangible
That was directly connected to you.

Something created in my body,
Salty and wet, just as you were.

tamale-filled and Dos Equis-soaked,
wake the caged birds who make
drowsy attempts to answer,
tuck curved beaks under
iridescent wings, close their eyes,
fall away into a lost sky.

In the morning, I call them macaws, the word
parrot too melodious for their shrieks and squawks,
jarring without a jungle chord beneath them.
I stand in a ring of droppings that paint
the concrete around their hotel cage
and apologize. I explain it is their beauty,

a caged jaguar screams
a sound unformed by tongue,
amplified by rib bellows,
pressed through iron bars
until it shatters my tourist sleep,
brings me to the animal’s side.

Once jaguars slid silently through
this jungle, spots rippling tall grass
vertical as swords. Their cries echoed
nine times in temples bearing their names,
and priests bent in fear and gratitude
offering sacrificial hearts to holy jaws.

What can I know of a caged god’s needs?

my head on a pillow, my legs on his lap.
We read poetry for we need something to do.

adding burrs, scratchy threads that shoot in all directions--
You spent so much time plying the threads, interlacing them to a thick mass,
felted-in tighter all the time, with each push of the hands.
You crafted it well, blunting those once-graceful edges to roughness.

Oh those jumbled colors, jagged juxtapositions like frayed nerves.
It’s heavy, overloaded with grime and layers of painful moments,
strata of fear.

  <description>Letter from the Editor
As we were preparing to take this issue online, I had this flashback to my final
year at Austin College in Sherman, TX. Jim Croce was on his way to the school
for a concert but his plane crahed on take off at the airport in Natchitoches.

To do the things you want to do
Once you find them...

  <description>The first time I saw
a preschool kid
(Do they have schools here?)
smoking a cigarette I
just stood and stared

Mama-sans squatting
to pee along the road
never drew a second glance
But a child casually smoking
was hard for me to unsee

For a month I had a
reoccurring dream of
a smoking toddler a
circus performer eating glass
and a ward filled with

Thalidomide babies
But after about
four weeks the dream
became a memory of
a dream of a memory

  <description>The wind rustles through pines, birches, and others unnamed.
An owl’s wings slash the smudges of charcoal.
Suddenly, night is sharpened into onyx.
Somewhere a mouse is surely seized and devoured.
Between wind and pursuit and downfall all you hear is silence.

You walk and walk,
although you can’t remember donning these hiking boots.
You walk as if you were called here. And you were.
You’ve come a long way to this arboreal assembly.
You’ve sought out these hills, these strands of lushness.

  <description>An excerpt from the Novel by Philip Cioffari

Prologue

August, 1998

Four of them, stripped to their shorts, stood on the riverbank, eyes fixed
across
Hell Gate at the lights of Queens.

This had been Charlie’s idea. Let’s swim it.

No one protested. Not Johnny or Danny. Not even Mooney, the weakest swimmer
among them. No one dared.

No sweat, Charlie said. Can’t be more than half a mile. Can’t be.

Across the river the lights flared, spur-like, diffused, beyond the roiling
currents.

Tonight i</description>

No one arrives on purpose
but the writers with their
laptops and little notebooks,

digging around, intruding
upon the squirrels,
the cardinals, the crows,
and the bullfrogs
of the valley.

Bottom-lands: soil rich
from the run-off of nutrients
down the mountains.
Everything of value slides
like the map on a Yaqui
man’s face.

He’s sure it was here,
as he digs this way and that,

  <description>I. The Mission

There was something out of the ordinary in the way my aunt asked about the black
duffel bag that I had schlepped all over the western world. Of COURSE I knew it
(as in “you know that bag of yours?”); even knew where it WAS. And of COURSE she
could use it for any lawful purpose (this point to come back up for discussion
sooner than I thought). So I had scarcely finished giving her thumbs up on the
black duffel when something told me to call her back to see what she had in
mind. It</description>

Feels like being buried alive,
knowing this is the end
No more oxygen
No more breaths
Just these four walls
and blackness
But I’m not in a coffin
in the ground
beneath fresh dirt.
I’m at a meeting,
a planning commission meeting.
I nod at a commissioner.
She nods back.
She probably thinks I’m fine,
not screaming on the inside
hoping someone will hear me
and dig me up.
She doesn’t know my brain is a prison,
that I’m on death row.
I’d tell her, but I can’t breathe.
I smile instead.</description>

  <description>It was the day after the annual company picnic, held every June, that Charlene
went to the doctor for her “well visit”—a requirement to maintain her insurance
benefits. The timing was considerably inopportune given that the picnic was a
veritable festival for the taste buds and was simply not to be missed. Charlene
had a particular fondness for the boss’s wife’s spicy fried chicken which
practically danced an attention-getting salsa until Charlene piled several
pieces on her plate. And Philomena</description>

because I had friends over
and didn’t want to fight

He called me a stupid bitch.
I was used to that.
He blocked me from leaving.
I was used to that.
He pushed me back.
I was used to that.
My legs landed on the edge of the tub.
My head hit the hard, gray tile.
I sat there crying,
legs hanging in the air
like a discarded rag doll.
I wasn’t used to that,

The first part of the story began while I was still living in the River Quay,

story starts when I was trying to learn how to make silk screen prints. My
subject was a stand of trees near my grandmother’s house that I had been looking
at for as long as I could remember. I managed to complete it; not too bad for a
first attempt. The print was displayed in a local art galle</description>

salvaged when the money-laundering Mafiosi purchased and modernized the 19th
century hotel in our little town. They saw no conflict with using historic
preservation grant money to gut the original fixtures and put in hot tubs. Being
from Kansas City, they were quite up-to-date.

This particular tub went to a good home; a home where it was loved and cherished
as a haven. Without turning on a light, I shivered out of m</description>

Thanks to broken tech-knowledg-ee, we enjoyed a two week respite from the online
world. A violent thunderstorm in late June blew out our internet connection and
wi-fi devices, so we were offline for two whole weeks. It was a flustration,
since we weren’t able to cue in on the latest headlines of Trumpmania, kitty cat
videos, and junk email. But what a relief, to be freed from those latest
never-ending reminders of the crazy world in which we live.

  <description>One cow separates herself from the herd,
stretches her neck, too far if you grew
up hugging cows. She stands on a cliff,
which our timid, clumsy animals would
never do, and points her horns toward
incoming ships. This is a fictional cow,
artifice from a painter’s brush, yet the way
she lifts her head, smells the sea air, seems
real, as if she thinks she’s come to the end
of fences, senses a reward of salt.

Once I sailed away on the broad back of a pet cow

and features that will draw people from distant places to enrich their lives,
and their children’s, by a visit (preferably overnight) to our town or region.
In many ways, I am a tourist myself, having returned to the land of my father’s
youth only a few months ago, and see new sights (mostly barns and creek beds)
almost every day.

But my strongest credential on this subject is that I have grown up, attended

Four years, 208 days, and 13 hours. Earth years, Earth days, and Earth hours.
That was the time since the catastrophic fire and explosion at Ganymede Station
1, or GS1. GS1 was the first colony on Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter,
and by far the most ambitious extraterrestrial effort humans had ever made.
Ganymede, with its thin but oxygen-rich atmosphere and subterranean liquid water
ocean, was deemed the most likely candidate for a permanent colony. The
colonists knew that this </description>

Lights dim
Audience calms

The pianist steps onto the stage
with vibrant confidence

She gracefully softens the applause
As she takes her seat

Her hands brush across her lap
Smoothing out the wrinkles in her gown

She takes a deep breath
and closes her eyes

Releasing her fingers to the ivories
She summons all to her harmonic sanctuary

The moment melts into the melody
She becomes one with the keyboard

From the balcony
I listen

Wondering how she found
nirvana so young

The deep silence of the forest quickly descends and we are swallowed by the vast

full moon, we lie down on a moss covered stone and fall asleep, entering the
dreamscape as one. In the dream we stand in a large meadow in the middle of a

Sometimes, surrounded by the endless Minnesota sky, I believe I have come home.
Other times, I am sure moving from New York City to rural Minnesota was a
mistake.

It is morning, and I walk the half-mile down my gravel driveway, humming a
melody that may one day grow up to be a song. Pastures unfold in every
direction, separated by copses of aspen and pine, oak and maple. Like most
autumn mornings while burgundy leaves linger on the oaks, I take Meadow for</description>

changing blueprints as lust dissolved,
and windows opened

Foundation – poured.

For months,

  <description>Polka dots go there to be reborn under a dry sky
that relishes its deep knowledge of jay

and a carcass on the verge associates with vultures
under a storm of Kudzu vines, as barn cats writhe

and posture according to their calendar.
Polka dots go where corn knows the tribulation

of becoming hominy, where scattered tinfoil draws
a murder and its crows and mamma fries

the Sunday chicken, peppered, dipped in egg and flour,
as she sidesteps rumors of coon stew

served with pone, the scraps fed to</description>

  <description>April 1972: I was back home at my parent’s house for Spring break from the
Memphis College of Art when I noticed the strange looking gold hoops lying on
the sink in the bathroom. They were perfectly round, about the size of a nickel,
with an opening that had a gold ball on one end and a very sharp point on the
other end of the loop. Next to the hoops was an instruction pamphlet that read:
place the earrings on the lobe, leave in place and the earrings will self-pierce
in a matter of weeks. I the</description>

  <description>Silently you fall
And kill without a sound
The old, the poor
The sick and unsound
You kill the exposed
Who can’t pay their bills
They die in their beds
In the Arkansas hills
In houses and shacks
Long ago new
They search for warmth
And food for a few
You gave the blessed
A beautiful morning
And touched a heart or two
But for those who shake
Under threadbare blankets
You’re ugly as sin
And they rue the day
They ever laid eyes
On you.</description>

  <description>It’s not that her vision was too small
but her experience too limited, too sad
She wanted for fresh horizons
so I decided to take Miss Emily

on a road trip. She sits shotgun--
insists upon it—while I drive.
We let Google Maps navigate
so we can focus on weightier matters

like the transcendence of the soul,
the ephemerality of experience, and
whether pan pizza is superior to thin crust.
We see the sights. I realize

that I’m thirsty, but she only tastes
a liquor never brewed. We keep the Sabbat</description>

  <description>Technology grief
Feelings of incompetence
Fight- feelings at least.

Trumpets hark of doom
Black swan with orange toupee
Divides the water.

Prairie fires are low,
Fake news is the oxygen.
The truth disappears in flames.

Prioritize. Pray.
Find oxygen in water.
Drown fear, have your say.

Regulation woes.
Deregulation chaos.
Where do I fit in?

Sure of their leanings,
Lemmings are marching this year.
The cliff is a myth.</description>

  <description>On a steep trail in the National Forest,
Deep in a remote area of Crawford County, Arkansas,
I pushed off hard to make it up over
The tangle of large rocks on that stretch.

So focused was I on my feet that I failed to see the branch
above.
The crack of my head on the branch knocked me back,
Back into a slow motion timeless fall
Where I seemed to drift.

While my body tried to find its balance
My mind raced ahead, enumerating my options,
Hoping for a miracle on a hillside
strewn with loose rock.</description>

Scratched her mind, 78 rpm.
Dead wax, matrix grooved.
Silent spin. Slowly moved.

She knew Ben was speaking,
but she couldn’t hear.
Was he rubbing her back?
She felt nothing, no tear.
She saw his eyes searching hers for the tell. All she could do was turn off her
cell.
Then...

    &quot;Finn is dead.&quot;


she thought she said
her brain fraught,
fought thought

    “I’ll never again see, my forever Plan B.”

  <description>I touched Beaver Lake today
She was cold
Her heart barely beating
Alive though
Her banks retreating
No one rode on her skin today
Or swam in her arms
Or came out to play
She bled through the dam
Though she had little to give
For lights, for air
For others to live
She sparkles in the sunrise
Of each new day
Waiting for summer’s warmth
A heartbeat away.</description>

in Thunder Bay. An elderly couple and their unmarried son, Walter, rattled
around the other two floors. They were the last three family members still
living in a house once inhabited by a family of twelve children and an
assortment of dogs and cats. All of them, including the dogs and cats, were my
friends when I was growing up next door.

I have sixteen students
from seven separate schools
and of those eager, energetic souls
four are named Caitlyn (Kaitlyn/Kaitlin/Katelyn).
Statistically speaking, this means
25% of the class is named Caitlyn.
And each of them spells it differently.

I am reduced to calling on
Kaitlin from Guthrie, or
Caitlyn in Choctaw. But in
my mind I’m hearing
Kaitlyn, the Amazon Warrior
Caitlyn, Assassin of the Cult of the Red Scimitars

  <description>Matthew Youngblood carefully removed binoculars from his daypack. He trained
them on the top of a finger of rock that stood, separated 30 or 40 feet from the
southwest rim of the ridge that he was lying on, stomach down. The finger of
rock was a column of sandstone, maybe 50 feet high, tapering upward and flat on
top, piled with sticks.

The hike to this remote site had been prompted by his observation of a
magnificent bald eagle hen that he’d been watching for several weeks. The

“…old in a blossoming earth” Robert Creeley

In the south of my childhood, time passed
like a plate of ham. Grandma made lard biscuits,

cooked rashers of bacon, fried lamb chops,
presided over the hugging and sassing

and eating and telling and pulling of sticker burrs.
I looked to her for solace and solutions. She delivered

axioms and injunctions and was indifferent to the one,
strong chin hair that grew and when pulled, grew again,

unkillable as a cockroach. How and why

She claws her way back north.

She loses a nail along the way.

I can’t read more than two pages without a break. Yet, the form of word has
always held my attention. My earliest memory of reading is seeing nothing but
letters. I walked through a city of capital Bs and stepped over lower case gs
watching Ss swirl overhead and js chase the quirky qs. I held an open book on my
lap and fell into the dance of letters on the page. Letters that moved when
touched by adjacent characters—tall and small, 30-point and 12, Times New</description>

  <description>I heard the downstairs door slam. I didn’t look up. It was so long since a
client pounded on my door I had to put Mitzi on part-time. If you took a look at
Mitzi, you’d understand why that was a last resort. I didn’t even look up when I
heard the high heels on the stairs. The sounds echo off the plaster walls and
wood floorboards. When the heels stopped outside the outer office door, I
looked. There was a shape through the frosted glass. The shape knocked.

  <description>Fall is a beautiful time of year
Lazy, golden sunlight presides over little wind
Until a cold breeze signals change

A reminder
The brilliant colors of fall
Are as transient as life

And will die to be buried underfoot
Then reborn
With the fresh breath of spring.</description>

pulled down low, brim almost touching
your chin, bulging backpack brandished
like a shield. I can barely see you.
The classroom isn’t large enough
for you to sit as far back as you would like
Shrinking
What secrets are concealed
by a monochrome wardrobe, always black.
Is that faraway look turned outward
or inward? Do you gaze into the future
or the past? And what of this moment?
Now.

low water, of dry sumps, of deer come close to the cow pond and cattle down to
the licklog, of NO BURN signs everywhere. You have to remember 2012, the second
hottest year on record or 1956, which by word of mouth was the first. But this
summer I’m writing about was the worst summer since Satan fell or so we thought.

Poems heal the human heart

no, it’s a welcome guest
We could not stop it anyhow—
the soul will meet the test

I hope you’ll come and visit
a salon must have friends
Together we will find the strength

  <description>The stones are curling, against all probability, against gravity struggling for
supremacy.
You know this, that stones are malleable, stuffed in or under or wrapped around
toes
Impediments or monuments, talismans by which to recall pain,
recall spells they claimed to cast
rituals they buried deep.
The stones change shape at will, not something you control although your
fingers
itch to do so, to control a small pebble, control the mountain, control the
avalanche.
But long ago stones came and tamed</description>

wooded land on the Pennsylvania side of the Mason-Dixon Line.

His wife died several years earlier, and he managed his grieving process pretty
well. The few close friends they had took the time to fuss over him for a week
or two, inviting him over for meals, calling him when they were going to the
grocery store, inquiring if he needed anything and generally being attentive.

It was August, so I told myself as I walked outside into the blinding sun that
it was fine because I’d have more time to spend at the river. But that was a
lie; I was nervous like I’d never been before. I counted the money I had taped
behind my dresser in my head while I walked the highway from town back toward

light’s slanted shine.  This is the season that loses
